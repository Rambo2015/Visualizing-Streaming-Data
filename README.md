# Visualizing-Streaming-Data

![](cover.jpg)

This is intended to be a companion to the book here: 
<br/> https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Streaming-Data-Interactive-analysis/dp/1492031852/
<br/> Organized by chapter / subject. 
<br/> if you have an issue getting something to work or want to suggest a new link / example please create an issue.
<br/> I'm also always looking for interesting places to apply some of these techniques. Let me know what your project is.
